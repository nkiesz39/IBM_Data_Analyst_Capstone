# IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone

## Background Information
This project was undertaken as a part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone course on Coursera.

For this project, we assume that we are a Data Analyst at a Global IT and Business Consulting Firm. In order to keep pace with changing technologies, the organization regularly analyzes data and trends to identify future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, we have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging technology skills.

Each step of the data analysis process is shown in different notebook of this repository and some aditional files needed for their understanding.
